title: (GSoC) Improving the State of Optim

# Let's get GSoC started!
Wonderful! I've been accepted into the Google Summer of Code program under the [NumFOCUS](http://www.numfocus.org/) organization or, more specifically, [JuliaOpt](http://www.juliaopt.org/).

My project is going to be on general improvement to the pure Julia optimizatio suite collected in [Optim.jl](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Optim.jl). To get a flavor of the project, let me quote the abstract from GSoC's website:

"The purpose of this GSoC project is to work on a variety of loose ends in, and general improvements to, the optimization package Optim.jl. Optim.jl is written entirely in the Julia Language, and organized under the JuliaOpt o
rganization. Improvements are in the form of a unified documentation effort, performance tests, improved algorithms, unit tests, and general bug fixing. At the end of GSoC Optim.jl should be a relatively well-polished, documented, and tested package for optimization in Julia."

To kick off the community bonding period, I've written a [short introduction at the julia-opt mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/julia-opt/9Ah5SQYYlgg) that you're welcome to read and respond to.
